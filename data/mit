VEntrepreneurial Negotiations: The MIT Way (April 26, 2016 - June 7, 2016) \u000aRegistration closes 5/3/2016. \u000a\u000aThis Digital Programs course is led by MIT's renowned negotiation expert, Professor Lawrence Susskind, who also cofounded the inter-university Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School. Participants in the program will practice negotiation skills via simulations, role-plays, case studies, and peer-provided feedback. They will emerge with a toolkit of negotiation techniques that will prepare them to join the MIT entrepreneurial success story.\u000a\u000aAt the end of the program you will be able to:\u000a\u000a- Protect and increase the value of your ideas\u000a- Deal with ego and the need to build trust in relationships\u000a- Navigate the bargaining process when economic uncertainty and technical complexity are at stake\u000a- Master the MIT way of winning at entrepreneurial negotiations

V"Integral Models for Shimura Varieties of Abelian Type"\u000a\u000aThis purpose of this talk is to give an introduction to the existence of reasonable integral models for Shimura varieties of abelian type. I will mainly focus on examples, and mostly restrict our attention to Shimura varieties of Hodge type. Given the technical nature of the subject, several theorems will be stated imprecisely, but most of the details could be found in chapter 2 of Kisin's paper "Integral models for Shimura varieties of abelian type."

VGothicness is an exhibition curated for the Wolk Gallery by Brandon Clifford that examines the ubiquitous element of Gothic architecture, the rib. In the tradition of John Ruskin's analysis of the Gothic, Clifford isolates a series of peculiar moments of transition from functional to rhetorical ribs that hold resonance today - Pierness, Springness, and Vaultness. In doing so, he illuminates the strangeness of Gothic rib details, examining the possibilities, potentials, and peculiar moments that parallel contemporary digital practice. \u000a\u000aBrandon Clifford is the Belluschi Lecturer in the MIT Department of Architecture and Principal of Matter Design, Boston.

VGothicness is an exhibition curated for the Wolk Gallery by Brandon Clifford that examines the ubiquitous element of Gothic architecture, the rib. In the tradition of John Ruskin's analysis of the Gothic, Clifford isolates a series of peculiar moments of transition from functional to rhetorical ribs that hold resonance today - Pierness, Springness, and Vaultness. In doing so, he illuminates the strangeness of Gothic rib details, examining the possibilities, potentials, and peculiar moments that parallel contemporary digital practice. \u000a\u000aBrandon Clifford is the Belluschi Lecturer in the MIT Department of Architecture and Principal of Matter Design, Boston.

VMIT was one of the initial occupants of Boston's Back Bay in the 1860s, but within 40 years there was little vacant acreage for the maturing Institute to acquire in the rapidly developing neighborhood. By the early 20th century MIT began to explore in earnest for a new site. This exhibit celebrates MIT's move in 1916 across the Charles River to its current location in Cambridge. The Great Stride illuminates the people who envisioned, labored, and provided the resources to build the "New Technology" and celebrates the three days of festivities and dedication in June of 1916 which hailed the new campus. \u000a\u000aMaihaugen Gallery Hours: Monday-Friday, 10 AM-4 PM

VList Projects: Narrative Color considers the relationship between color and narrative in a small selection of artists films and videos made since 1970. The works contents and structures are diverse, ranging from investigations into capital and ideology in postwar Germany to Hollywood melodrama and contemporary fashion. However, each work uses a non-traditional narrative structure to present a sequence of events or actions, for which color both informs and is informed by the respective works narrative. Furthermore, speech spoken on-screen or by an off-screen narrator is fundamental to their treatments of color. Significantly, these attributes distinguish them from the legacy of artists films since the 1950s, which largely treat color as something that exists independent of language.  The exhibition features KP Brehmer, Bernadette Corporation, Mareike Bernien and Kerstin Schroedinger, Derek Jarman, and Bruce and Norman Yonemoto.

VJoin MIT List Visual Arts Center staff for a mindful, artful workshop that aims to reduce stress by looking, discussing, and sketching. Take a moment for self-care and join in this study break to spend time in the galleries with museum staff and students. This workshop focuses on Mark Di Suvero's bold, colorful sculpture "Aesop's Fables, II" (2005). Look closely to untangle the active, industrial sculpture, then enjoy guided sketching in the space. All materials for sketching are provided. \u000a\u000aAbout the Workshops\u000a\u000aSlow Looking Art Workshops are a series of interventions at the List Visual Arts Center that harness the natural role of art to provoke reflection and contemplation. The List invites MIT students to slow down, observe and reflect among peers, and create drawings in a quiet environment. Using the art exhibitions on display in our galleries and across the Institute, an experienced facilitator and guest co-facilitator will lead students in a "slow looking" activity (group discussion of one carefully selected work of art) followed by guided sketching using quality art supplies.
